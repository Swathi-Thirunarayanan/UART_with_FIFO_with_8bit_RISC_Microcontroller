# UART_with_FIFO_with_8bit_RISC_Microcontroller
The main objective of the project is to design UART with Baud Generator and FIFO buffer to run on 8 Bit RISC Microcontroller in 4 modes.

## Functions of the modes are as follows:
1) Write Program into memory (RAM) of Microcontroller through UART and FIFO buffer
2) Execute Code
3) Read back program from memory to host machine via UART
4) Read back results after execution from microcontroller to host machine.
